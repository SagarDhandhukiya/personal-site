github/kgritesh/ethcloud


A cli tool to launch, use and manange an ethereum client on the cloud. Under the hood ethcloud uses ansible and native cloud provider api's to launch a new cloud instance, runs an ethereum client on it and provide an interface as if the client is running locally. It tries to support all commands and options for the ethereum client tool and comes with good defaults, but allows configuring all the parameters with a configuration file.
