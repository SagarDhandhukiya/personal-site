description: 'A complete no-code functional testing platform for mobile applications'
---

Pirlo.io was a side project with an aim to make it extremely simple for app developers to test their mobile apps. We built a complete no-code platform that allowed our users to automatically generate functional tests for their apps without writing any code, automatically maintain and heal those tests as there are minor UI changes in the app as well execute these tests on a cloud device farms. There were lot of interesting technical challenges involved and I really enjoyed hacking on the solution.
